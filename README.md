# Mini Healthcar

This is a mini healthcare support system with a layered backend architecture and modular frontend. It includes an automation feature that generates an AI-style summary of patient issues.

Currently, the AI logic is rule-based, but the service layer is designed so it can be replaced by an LLM or NLP model without changing controllers or routes.
